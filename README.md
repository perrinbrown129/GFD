# GFD

## Approach

As someone who has lived with Celiac disease for over 20 years, I wanted to create an app that served as a directory for a certain gluten-free food. I discovered in the app stores and on the web that there is no comprehensive list of 100% gluten-free canned alcoholic beverages. As more adults are being diagnosed with gluten intolerances, they are looking for more safe ready-made alcoholic beverages. Thus, GFD was born. GFD allows users to browse a limited selection of the most popular gluten-free seltzers and ciders to learn more about their ABV, taste, flavors and availability.

## Unsolved Problems

As with most, if not all, websites about alcohol, I had hoped to create a pop up that asked if visitors were 21+ but the logic has stumped me (for now). I had also hoped to populate the site with more seed data but that will be upgraded another day. Lastly, I hope to optimize the mobile view.
